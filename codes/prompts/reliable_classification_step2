I will give you a response about if a patch contains reliable hints about the bug type. You are tasked with undertanding the response and conclude it in a json format; for example:
{
"contain reliable hints":"yes",
"bug type":"OOB"
}
or
{
"contain reliable hints":"no",
}
if the response is unclear about if a patch contains reliable hints about the bug type,
{
"contain reliable hints":"unclear"
}
Need to note that the bug type should be one of the following: use-after-free, out-of-bounds access, null pointer dereference, use before initilization, memory leak, missing permission check.
If the bug type does not fall into any of the above, you can just answer "other" for the "bug type" field.
Your output should only contain the json format conclusion.
The given response is as follows:
